Test your highway code knowledge and help prepare for your theory test by using the Highway Code Quiz App. 
The Highway Code Quiz App is a simple easy to use quiz app consisting of ten quick questions written in the multiple choice style format as used by the DVLA for the official theory test. 
The app can be used just for fun or to help you revise while on the go to help you prepare for the types of questions that are asked on the official Theory Test. 

Please note that this app has just been built for proof of concept and should not be used to actually revise for a real world Theory Test. 

The current questions in the app have been sourced from the free to use test questions supplied by the DVLA on the free to use mock tests. These questions may not actually be used on any official Theory Test. 

This app was designed to work as a stand-alone app to help people brush up on their Highway Code knowledge as well as potentially prepare for a DVLA Theory Test.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the game to be very minimal and take it's inspiration from the physical motorway and roadways. 

The background is kept to a dark grey representing the grey asphalt on the roadways.

I used the red, green and amber colours from the classic British traffic lights. This was used for the main logo and also the correct and incorrect answers while using amber as a highlight colour for certain sections. 

The white was an obvious choice to contrast well against the dark grey 'asphalt' background and is supposed to represent the white road markings we see on our roads. 

I was aware that using the colours red and green could be an issue for colour blindness. Taking this into consideration I made sure to add the scoreboard section to help players when see their score if they got a correct or incorrect answer.

### Typography

Helvetica Bold was used throughout the game.

I was looking for a font that closely matched the standard font used on the UK motorway and road signs and this worked well. 

Ariel and Sans Serif was used as back up.
